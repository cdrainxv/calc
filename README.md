# Book CMS

Live: [react-calculator](https://basic-react-calc.herokuapp.com/)

## Purpose

Refamiliarize myself react and create something practical which I would actually use. Additionally, I made use of [big-js](https://www.npmjs.com/package/big-js) to deal with very large values and [styled-components](https://www.npmjs.com/package/styled-components) to style the components.

This calculator supports +, -, /, and x operations. Additionally, clearing of input, percentage, and negation options are included. The ui is designed to closely resemble MacOS native simple calculator.
